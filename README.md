Web scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website. Unlike screen scraping, which only copies pixels displayed onscreen, web scraping extracts underlying HTML code and, with it, data stored in a database. The scraper can then replicate entire website content elsewhere. For example: We want to get data of samsung,realme,redmi,one+ phones. From a web scraping of flipkart or amazon like websites and get previously mentioned data of phones.
